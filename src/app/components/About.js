                <p>I have a flair for front-end but I also have skills to share in back-end development too! I spend a lot of my time sharpening my skills, attending networking events and workshops, keeping my LinkedIn page up to date and building my portfolio site (psst - youâ€™re already here!). I am currently doing freelance work for Intrepid English, an ESOL company.</p>
                     
                <p>I know that this field will be a source of constant learning and I could not be more excited! Learning new things brings me such joy and inspires me. </p>
