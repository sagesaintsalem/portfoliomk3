        <p>After building a cosmetic clone of Disney+, I am now very keen to build a proper streaming site of my own. My idea is to make a fictional site that streams old films which are in public domain. I am currently in the planning phase of this project.
            
            I recently learned how to make an API (coming soon to the site!) and now I want to take on a bigger task. There is an API for all of the contestants and episodes on the American version of <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RuPaul%27s_Drag_Race' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer' ><em>RuPaul's Drag Race</em></a> and I would like to make something similar but for the alternative reality drag show <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Boulet_Brothers%27_Dragula' target='_blank' rel='noreferrer'><em>Dragula</em></a>. I am also a member of the Scottish Tech Army, which is a nonprofit which aims to provide voluntary tech services to charities.  I am currently helping to make an interactive map for the charity with Google Maps. Here's an example of a map i made to help people find dog-friendly pubs in Glasgow! â†’ </p>
